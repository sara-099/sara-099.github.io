    <img src="assets/Mf.jpg" class="rounded-circle img_about" alt="BeeU logo">
<p class="paragraphs">Sara Mallick is a rising businesswoman. She started her entrepreneurial adventure a year ago and has accomplished amazing feats. She earned an associate's degree in data science from Wake Tech Community College in North Carolina and hence developed this website as a component of her web development class portfolio project.
</p>
    <p class="paragraphs">Her close ones describe her to be extremely disciplined, a strong advocate of sticking to your morals and principles, and a strong believer in upholding a professional attitude while in the workforce. Sara is often seen as a leader with empathy and honor, and is frequently regarded as someone who values her staff members and treats them with respect.</p>
    <p class= "paragraphs">Since school, sara has always believed in perfectionism and attention to detail. She is a tireless, perfectionist enthusiast which makes her stand out of the crowd.</p>
    
<h2 class="headings_about"><i>BeeU History and goals</i></h2>     


  <p class= "paragraphs">I can still picture the occasion that gave me the inspiration for BeeU. When I was younger, either because of Pityriasis Alba or acne, my skin would be in horrible shape, and when I would look online for skincare products, I would discover that they were excessively expensive and would use misleading tactics to entice clients. On that day, I made the decision to dedicate myself to helping everyone who shares my enthusiasm for self-care.</p>

<p class="paragraphs">A tireless mindset, numerous sleepless nights, and a fierce desire to outperform my rivals were all part of the development process. To make sure that my website is appropriate and appealing to my target audience, I manually coded everything which added a heavy weight on my workload. My aim was obvious, but the journey was difficult since I entered an industry that was very competitive. I felt demotivated, stumbled, and made mistakes yet I persisted in going forward. After many days of effort and hard work, BeeU was finally materialized on 27 April 2023, and so did my desire to diligently and unceasingly serve my BeeU community.
