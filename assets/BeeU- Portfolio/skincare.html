<p class="paragraphs" >The Korean skin is renowned for being the most luminous and glass-like. It goes without saying that Koreans pay a great deal of care to their skin and adopt preventive measures starting at a very young age. Easy lifestyle practices like cleaning your face after sweating, changing your pillowcases and bedsheets once a week, making sure you wash your hands frequently, etc. will significantly improve the appearance of your skin.</p>
    <p class="paragraphs"> Many women get excited when starting a skincare routine and buy a ton of products, which they stop using within a week. Like working out, caring for your skin is a lifelong journey where you start small and work your way up. When caring for our skin, we should follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) maxim. Women who aren't accustomed to using a lot of facial cosmetics run the danger of irritating their skin and doing more harm than good hence, beginners should start with the fundamental routine of <a href="#cleanser">cleansing</a>, <a href="#toning">toning</a>, <a href="#treating">treating</a> and <a href="#moisturizing">moisturizing</a>.</p>
    
<h2>1. Cleanser</h2>
<img src="Pictures/pexels-kay-ogudoro-11436269.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" alt="Cleansers"/>
<p class="paragraphs">Cleanser is the first step in any skincare routine. Any dirt or particles that may have gotten into your pores over the day are removed by cleansing your skin. Why is it the first step? Well, because if you don't clean your skin, there will be a layer of filth and grime that prevents other products from penetrating your skin. Yikes!  </p>
<h2 class="h2">How to cleanse your skin the right way</h2>
<ul>
  <li style="font-size: large;"><strong>Determine your skin.</strong></li>
      <p class="paragraphs">The first step towards cleansing is to know your skin type so that you can select a cleanser that directly addresses your skin concerns. If you have a dry skin, you should stay away from alcohol-based harsh cleansers that would rip off your moisture barrier. On the contrary, if you have a normal skin, you can experiment with pretty much every cleanser. If you have a oily skin, you are looking for somethng that would clear out your pores gently.</p>
      

      <li class="paragraphs"><strong>Remove all makeup</strong></li>
      
  <p class="paragraphs">Removing your makeup before cleansing is an essential step to never miss! You need to remove your makeup with the help of a makeup remover before you beging cleansing. If you leave makeup overnight, you risk clogging your pores and hence, leading to acne.</p>
  <li class="paragraphs"><strong>Wash your face using a non-abrasive cleanser and lukewarm water.</strong></li>
  <p class="paragraphs">Lukewarm water is best for removing dirt and grime from your face while not overly stripping and drying. However, a splash of cold water every now and then may also help your complexion. </p>
  <li class="paragraphs"><strong>Use your fingers to gently cleanse your skin </strong></li>
  <p class="paragraphs">Use your fingers and move it in a circular motion to gently cleanse your face. Anything other than your fingers may irritate your skin.</p>
  
</ul>
    <h2 id="toning" style= "margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 300px">2. Toner </h2>
    <img src="Pictures/pexels-victoria-emerson-6181903.jpg" alt="toner" class="img_skincare">
                                                                                                        
<p class="paragraphs">Personally, I dislike toners because there are so many harsh alcohol-based toners on the market that strip and irritate skin. However, they are a fantastic way to remove the dirt and grime that your cleanser missed. Some dermatologists like <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19952473/how-to-use-facial-toner/">Christine Choi Kim, MD</a>, says that toners deserve a second look and have made a tremendous comeback due to the korean 10 step skincare routine. Toners are meant to prepare your skin for moisturizers or serums that you may apply. According to <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19952473/how-to-use-facial-toner/">Rebecca Kazin, MD,</a> toners were originally meant to balance out your skin's pH. However, our cleansers are advancing and are becoming more pH balanced and gentle. Everyone can use a face toner, however, they are expecially useful for people with oily skins. </p>
    <h2 style= "margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 300px">How to select a toner.</h2>
    <p class="paragraphs"> You will find products which contain witch hazel and astringents describes as a toner. If you have dry, normal, combination or oily skin, the best toner for your skin is an alcohol free toner. An alcohol free toner will not dry out your skin. This is specially important if you have dry or very dry skin. All skin types should avoid toners with fragrances, since they can be irritating.

    <h2 id="treating" style="margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 300px">3. Treating</h2>
    <img src="assets/essences_serums" alt="Essences and serums" width="350" height="271" style="margin-left: 50px"/>
<p class="paragraphs">You would specifically address your skin concerns in this stage. The use of essences and serums can be used to address some of the typical skin issues, such as post-acne hyperpigmentation, uneven skin tone, etc.</p>
   <ul class="paragraphs">
    <li>
        <strong>Essences</strong>
        <p>You would be familiar with these babies if you keep up with K-Beauty trends. Essences are a crucial component of the Korean skin care routine and are used to hydrate and nourish the skin. Essences are water-based formulations with active substances that are used to hydrate skin cells, soften and smooth the epidermis, and restore the pH of the skin. Essences assist your skin absorb other products better when they are used prior to serums and moisturizers, and they also aid in rehydrating your skin when applied after cleansers and toners.</p>
       </li>
       
       <li>
           <strong>Serums</strong>
       <p>The idea behind a serum is that greater concentrations of active molecules may be able to reach the skin's surface for best results. Also, because of the greater concentration, benefits are usually seen sooner.A serum is applied initially, following skin cleansing, because it is lightweight and immediately distributes active substances to the skin.

The next step is to apply a moisturizer or face cream since, in order to get the most out of the serum, you also need to lock it in.</p>  
     </li>
</ul>
    <h2 id="moisturizing">4. Moisturizing </h2>
    <img src="assets/moisturizers.jpg" alt="Moisturizer" style="width: 350px; height: 271px; margin-left: 50px"/>
<p class="paragraphs"><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocd.12490">Moisturizers</a> provide functional skin benefits, such as making the skin smooth and soft, increasing skin hydration, and improving skin optical characteristics; however, moisturizers also function as vehicles to deliver ingredients to the skin. These ingredients may be vitamins, botanical antioxidants, peptides, skin-lightening agents, botanical anti-inflammatories, or exfoliants. The type of moisturizer you incorporate into your skincare largely depends on your skin type.</p>
    <ul class="paragraphs">
    <li><strong>Oily/Combination</strong>: Lightweight, water based moisturizer</li><br> <br>
    <li><strong>Dry</strong>: Heavy, cream based moisturizers</li><br> <br>
    <li><strong>Normal</strong>: </li>
    Normal skin types can use any moisturizers however, if you want to avoid suffocating your skin with heavy creams, a lightweight moisturizer is your go to. 
    </ul>
    
<h2 style= "margin-left: 350px; margin-right: 300px">Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p class="paragraphs">It's crucial to follow your skin care routine consistently and to have patience to wait at least three months before deciding whether or not a product is effective for you. Each person has a unique type of skin. When introducing any new products into your skincare routine, it's vital to conduct a patch test because what may work for one person may not necessarily work for the next.</p>
