         <p class="card-text">I purchased the Scarlet Lipstick from BeeU as a gift for my wife on Valentine's day and she loved it! My wife said that the lipstick was not drying at all and gave her a nice matte finish as well. She is currently in contact with the BeeU team to produce more of such lipsticks in different shades. Highly recommended!!</p>

         <p class="card-text">I have acne problem since I was a teenager and ever since then I have been very careful to not irritate my skin. These premium brushes were very light weight and did not irritate my skin at all while using! Other brushes that I purchased from the drugstore made my acne worse because of how irritating they were :( </p>
